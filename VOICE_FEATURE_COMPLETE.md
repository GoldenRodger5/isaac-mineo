## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
```
FastAPI ‚Üí Voice Router ‚Üí Voice Service ‚Üí External APIs
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì
WebSocket  REST API     Deepgram      ElevenLabs
                      (Speech-to-Text) (Text-to-Speech)
```

### Frontend Stack

```

### Data Flow
1. **Voice Input**: User holds microphone ‚Üí WebRTC records ‚Üí WebSocket streams to backend
2. **Processing**: Backend processes with Deepgram ‚Üí integrates with chat system
3. **Voice Output**: Response synthesized with ElevenLabs ‚Üí streamed back to frontend
4. **Playback**: Frontend receives audio URL ‚Üí plays response to user

## üé® User Interface Elements

### Desktop Interface
- Voice status indicator with colored dots (green/yellow/red)
- "Start Voice Chat" button to begin voice mode
- Push-to-talk microphone button (hold to speak)
- Interrupt and stop controls
- Recording and processing status displays

### Mobile Interface
- Compact microphone button integrated with input area
- Touch-optimized controls (onTouchStart/onTouchEnd)
- Space-efficient design that doesn't crowd the interface
- Conditional display of controls based on availability

## üîß Configuration & Setup

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Deepgram (Speech-to-Text)
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key

# ElevenLabs (Text-to-Speech)  
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_preferred_voice_id
```

### Dependencies Added
**Backend:**
```bash
pip install deepgram-sdk elevenlabs
```

**Frontend:**
- Uses browser WebRTC (no additional packages needed)
- WebSocket integration with existing infrastructure

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Scripts Created
- `test_voice_chat.sh` - Comprehensive backend API testing
- `test_mobile_voice.js` - Mobile integration validation
- Manual testing procedures documented

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Backend voice service initialization
- ‚úÖ API endpoint accessibility
- ‚úÖ Frontend component integration
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness
- ‚úÖ Error handling and graceful fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Session management consistency

## üöÄ Deployment Ready

### Production Considerations
