# 🔧 CSS/MIME Type Error Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Identified:
- CSS files being served with incorrect MIME type
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` causing strict MIME checking
- Broad rewrite rules interfering with asset serving

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Explicit MIME Type Headers**
Added specific headers for different file types:
- `.css` files → `text/css; charset=utf-8`
- `.js` files → `application/javascript; charset=utf-8`
- `.html` files → `text/html; charset=utf-8`
- Service worker → Proper content type
- Manifest → Proper JSON content type

### 2. **Smart Rewrite Rules**
Changed from broad `(.*)` to exclude static assets:
```json
{
  "source": "/((?!assets|api|sw\\.js|manifest\\.json|favicon|.*\\.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|ico|pdf)).*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}
```

### 3. **Removed Strict MIME Checking**
Removed `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` that was causing the browser to reject CSS files.

### 4. **API Route Protection**
Added explicit API route handling to prevent interference with Vercel functions.

## 🚀 Deploy to Fix:

1. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix CSS MIME type and asset serving issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-deploy** with the fixed configuration

3. **Test the site** - CSS should load properly without MIME errors

## 🧪 Expected Results:
- ✅ No more "MIME type not supported" errors
- ✅ CSS and JS files load correctly
- ✅ No console errors related to stylesheets
- ✅ Site displays properly with all styling

The errors you saw should be completely resolved after this deployment! 🎉
