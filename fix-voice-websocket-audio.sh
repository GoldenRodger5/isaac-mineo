# Fix Voice WebSocket Audio Processing
# This script identifies and fixes the production voice WebSocket issues

echo "🔧 VOICE WEBSOCKET AUDIO FIX"
echo "=========================="
echo ""

echo "🔍 DIAGNOSIS:"
echo "Issue 1: Backend environment shows 'development' instead of 'production'"
echo "Issue 2: Deepgram WebSocket audio processing may have async/sync issues"
echo "Issue 3: Audio data format may not match Deepgram expectations"
echo ""

echo "📋 RECOMMENDED FIXES:"
echo ""

echo "1. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:"
echo "   Add to Render environment variables:"
echo "   ENVIRONMENT=production"
echo "   DEBUG=False"
echo "   (This will fix the environment reporting issue)"
echo ""

echo "2. DEEPGRAM WEBSOCKET PROCESSING:"
echo "   The current code calls dg_connection.send(audio_data) synchronously"
echo "   But Deepgram WebSocket may need proper async handling"
echo ""

echo "3. AUDIO FORMAT VERIFICATION:"
echo "   Client sends PCM Int16Array data"
echo "   Server receives as bytes and forwards to Deepgram"
echo "   Need to verify Deepgram is receiving correct format"
echo ""

echo "🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION:"
echo "1. Set ENVIRONMENT=production in Render dashboard"
echo "2. Test with the client audio debug script to see if Deepgram processes the audio"
echo "3. Check backend logs during audio processing"
echo ""

echo "📝 TESTING COMMAND:"
echo "After fixing environment variables, run:"
echo "   node test-client-audio-debug.js"
echo "   (This will test the complete audio pipeline in browser)"
echo ""

echo "🏥 BACKEND LOG ANALYSIS:"
echo "Look for these log messages during testing:"
echo "   - '📝 Transcript:' messages from Deepgram"
echo "   - 'Deepgram error:' messages"
echo "   - 'WebSocket message error:' messages"
echo ""

echo "✅ PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT SETUP:"
echo "Go to Render Dashboard > Environment Variables > Add:"
echo "   ENVIRONMENT = production"
echo "   DEBUG = False"
echo ""

echo "Then redeploy backend and test voice again."
