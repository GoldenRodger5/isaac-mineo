## ✅ Voice Implementation Fix Applied Successfully!

### Issue Resolved
The voice chat was failing because of an incorrect `await` statement in the Deepgram connection initialization.

**Problem:** 
```python
# This was incorrect - dg_connection.start() returns a boolean, not a coroutine
if not await dg_connection.start(options):
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Fixed - removed the await since it's synchronous
if not dg_connection.start(options):
```

### Backend Logs Confirm Fix
✅ **Before Fix:** `Failed to start live transcription: object bool can't be used in 'await' expression`
✅ **After Fix:** `🎙️ Deepgram live transcription started`

### Current Status
- ✅ Backend voice services: WORKING
- ✅ WebSocket connections: WORKING  
- ✅ Deepgram transcription: WORKING
- ✅ Voice status endpoints: WORKING
- ✅ Frontend integration: READY TO TEST

### Next Steps
1. **Test in Browser:** Open http://localhost:5173 and test the voice chat button
2. **Check Microphone Permission:** Ensure browser allows microphone access
3. **Test Recording:** Click the voice chat button and try speaking

### Test Results Summary
